# AI Research Assistant - Technical Documentation

## System Architecture

### Overview
The AI Research Assistant is built using a modular architecture with a state-based workflow system. It leverages LangGraph for orchestrating the research process and Streamlit for the user interface.

### Core Components

1. **State Management**
   - Uses TypedDict for strict type checking
   - Maintains research state including:
     - Query information
     - Research data
     - Fact checks
     - Professional report
     - Agent conversations
     - Iteration tracking

2. **Workflow System**
   - Implemented using LangGraph's StateGraph
   - Manages transitions between different research phases
   - Handles conditional routing based on fact-checking results
   - Components:
     - Entry point: Researcher agent
     - Processing nodes: Drafter, Fact Checker, Corrector, Validator
     - Final node: Report Generator

## Implementation Details

### Research Process Flow

1. **Initial Research Phase**
   - Researcher agent performs iterative research
   - Continues until maximum iterations reached
   - Gathers and processes information from various sources

2. **Draft Generation**
   - Drafter agent synthesizes research data
   - Creates initial comprehensive answer
   - Structures information logically

3. **Fact Checking**
   - Validates claims and statements
   - Marks issues with ❌ for correction
   - Ensures accuracy of information

4. **Correction Process**
   - Corrector agent addresses marked issues
   - Initiates additional research if needed
   - Maintains accuracy standards

5. **Final Validation**
   - Validator agent performs final quality check
   - Ensures all corrections are properly implemented
   - Verifies overall accuracy and completeness

6. **Report Generation**
   - Creates professional formatted report
   - Includes table of contents
   - Generates both Markdown and PDF versions

### UI Implementation

1. **Main Interface**
   - Streamlit-based responsive design
   - Two-column layout:
     - Left: Research results and reports
     - Right: Progress metrics and statistics

2. **User Controls**
   - Research query input
   - Iteration control (1-10)
   - Research depth selection
   - Start button trigger

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Iteration counter
   - Source count display
   - Issue tracking metrics

4. **Output Formats**
   - Interactive markdown display
   - Expandable verification details
   - Downloadable reports:
     - Markdown format
     - PDF format (using FPDF)

### Technical Features

1. **PDF Generation**
   - Custom implementation using FPDF
   - Automatic page breaks
   - Consistent formatting
   - Latin1 encoding for output

2. **State Persistence**
   - Session state management
   - Message history tracking
   - Progress persistence

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks for main execution
   - Graceful error reporting
   - User-friendly error messages

## Configuration Management

### Key Constants
- Minimum and maximum iterations
- Default iteration count
- Research depth options
- Page size for log display

### Environment Setup
- Dependencies managed via requirements.txt
- Environment variables in .env file
- Modular configuration in config.py

## Project Structure

```

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Modular design
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type hints for better maintainability

2. **Error Management**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Performance**

   - Optimized PDF generation
   - Paginated log display

## Future Enhancements

1. **Potential Improvements**
   - Additional export formats
   - Enhanced search capabilities
   - More detailed progress tracking
   - Advanced customization options

2. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Parallel processing support
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Resource optimization
